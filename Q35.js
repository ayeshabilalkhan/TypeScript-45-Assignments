// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
// Creating a Array
var petAnimals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Horse"];
// Using For-Loop
for (var _i = 0, petAnimals_1 = petAnimals; _i < petAnimals_1.length; _i++) {
    var onePet = petAnimals_1[_i];
    console.log("A ".concat(onePet, " Would make a great pet."));
}
// Print a Message `outside`  of for-Loop
console.log("\nAny of these Animals would make a great pet!");
