// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



let FriendsName: string[] = ["Aqsa", "Umar", "Ali", "Sara"];

FriendsName.forEach(message => console.log(`Hi ${message}, How Are You?`));
