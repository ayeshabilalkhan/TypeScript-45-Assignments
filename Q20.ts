// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.



// Define an array of countries
let countries: string[] = ["United States", "Canada", "Germany", "France", "Japan", "Australia", "South Africa"];

// Print each country in the array
console.log("List of Countries:");

// Print the values of array in the form of List
countries.forEach(country => console.log(country));
