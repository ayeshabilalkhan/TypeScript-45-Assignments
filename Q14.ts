// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.



let guestList: string[] = ["Shabana", "Rimsha", "Aqsa", "Sara"];

guestList.forEach(guest => console.log(`Salam ${guest}, Would you like to join me for dinner? I'd be honored to have your company.`));
